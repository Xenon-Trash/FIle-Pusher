# File-Pusher

File-Pusher is a simple auto file pusher designed for autoexec in the context of ROBLOX Corporation's game platform. It allows you to easily copy a directory (folder) to specific target locations within the ROBLOX Corporation application data directory.

## Why False Virus Detected?

File-Pusher may sometimes be flagged as a false positive for virus detection by certain antivirus software due to the nature of its operations. It uses Windows API functions for file and directory operations, including functions like `SHFileOperationW` and `SHGetFolderPathW`, which can be perceived as suspicious behavior by some antivirus engines.

However, it's important to note that File-Pusher is not a malicious program. The operations it performs are legitimate and aimed at copying a directory from the user's selected source folder to the appropriate destination folder within the ROBLOX Corporation application data directory. The file and directory operations are standard and used for legitimate purposes.

## How to Use

1. Download the compiled executable file from the [releases](https://github.com/Xenon-Trash/File-Pusher/releases) section.
2. Run the `File-Pusher.exe` application.
3. The application will prompt you to select a source folder. Choose the folder containing the files you want to copy to the ROBLOX Corporation application data directory.
4. File-Pusher will then identify the target directory within the ROBLOX Corporation application data folder and copy the selected source folder's content to that location.
5. You should see a "Successfully!" message displayed if the copy process is completed without any errors.

Please note that the effectiveness of this program depends on the specific configuration and setup of the ROBLOX Corporation application data directory on your system. Exercise caution and ensure you have a proper backup of important files before using File-Pusher.
